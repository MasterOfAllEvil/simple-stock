# Types of Contribution

1. Issue Reporting
  Even if something seems obvious, check if there is an issue, create one if there isn't one. 
  They are used to keep track of what needs to be developed next.
2. Code
  This is correlated to issues, only contribute code from an issue (can be a feature request).
  This is a minimal effort to prevent duplicate code being written.
3. Documentation
   Even thoug things may change quickly, it is appreciated to have someone write some basic
   docs. That said, please create an issue beforehand.
